#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"Bash is the default /bin/sh on a Debian system.  However, since the Debian "
"policy requires all shell scripts using /bin/sh to be POSIX compliant, any "
"shell that conforms to POSIX can serve as /bin/sh.  Since dash is POSIX "
"compliant, it can be used as /bin/sh.  You may wish to do this because dash "
"is faster and smaller than bash."
