Description: The Debian Almquist Shell
 "dash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "dash", and is a required part of the system.

Package: ash
Architecture: all
Pre-Depends: dash
Description: Compatibility package for the Debian Almquist Shell
 This package exists so that users of the "ash" package can upgrade to the
 "dash" package which replaces the former.  It includes the /bin/ash symlink.
 You can remove this package if you do not use /bin/ash explicitly.
