Template: dash/sh
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install dash as /bin/sh?
 The default /bin/sh shell on Debian and Debian-based systems is bash.
 .
 However, since the default shell is required to be POSIX-compliant,
 any shell that conforms to POSIX, such as dash, can serve as /bin/sh.
 You may wish to do this because dash is faster and smaller than bash.
