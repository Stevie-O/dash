_Description: Install dash as /bin/sh?
 Bash is the default /bin/sh on a Debian system.  However, since the Debian
 policy requires all shell scripts using /bin/sh to be POSIX compliant, any
 shell that conforms to POSIX can serve as /bin/sh.  Since dash is POSIX
 compliant, it can be used as /bin/sh.  You may wish to do this because
 dash is faster and smaller than bash.
