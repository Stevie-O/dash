Subject: [PATCH 27/27] [EVAL] don't clear eflag when forking subshell

According to
 http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_12
"A subshell environment shall be created as a duplicate of the shell
environment, except that signal traps set by that shell environment
shall be set to the default values."

Currently the eflag is cleared when forking a subshell, e.g.

$ dash -c 'set -e ; z=$(false;echo foo) ; echo $z'
foo

With this commit the eflag is preserved for subshells, and dash exits 1
before echo.

The problem was reported by Vincent Lefevre through
 http://bugs.debian.org/514863
