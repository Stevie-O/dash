Subject: [PATCH] dash.1: clarify description of -nt, -ot options to test builtin

Have the man page explicitely state how the test builtin behaves on
-nt and -ot options if file2 does not exist.  The case where file1
does not exist was already documented properly.

This was noticed by Sven Mueller and reported through
 http://bugs.debian.org/373611
